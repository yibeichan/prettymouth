event_1: When the phone rang, the gray-haired man asked the girl, with quite some little deference, if she would rather for any reason he didn't answer it.
event_2: "Hello?" he said resonantly into the phone.
event_3: A man's voice—stone dead, yet somehow rudely, almost obscenely quickened for the occasion—came through at the other end: "Lee? Did I wake you?"
event_4: "No, Christ. You didn't see her leave at all, then?"
event_5: "Yeah, yeah. They're not home yet."
event_6: "I have a feeling she went to work on some bastard in the kitchen."
event_7: "Where are you now, Arthur?" the gray-haired man asked.
event_8: "Look, Arthur, you want my advice?" he said.
event_9: "Yeah. I hear you."
event_10: "Yeah. I mean if it's all right with you."
event_11: "All right." The gray-haired man continued for a moment to hold the phone to his ear, then lowered it into its cradle.
event_12: "What did he say?" the girl immediately asked him.
event_13: "God! What did you say?" said the girl.
event_14: The phone suddenly rang.
event_15: "Hello?" he said into it.
event_16: "Listen, I just thought you'd want to know, Joanie just barged in."
event_17: "Listen, Arthur," the gray-haired man interrupted, taking his hand away from his face, "I have a helluva headache all of a sudden."
