event_1: When the phone rang, the gray-haired man asked the girl, with quite some little deference, if she would rather for any reason he didn't answer it. The girl heard him as if from a distance, and turned her face toward him, one eye—on the side of the light—closed tight, her open eye very, however disingenuously, large, and so blue as to appear almost violet. The gray-haired man asked her to hurry up, and she raised up on her right forearm just quickly enough so that the movement didn't quite look perfunctory. She cleared her hair back from her forehead with her left hand and said, "God. I don't know, I mean what do you think?" The gray-haired man said he didn't see that it made a helluva lot of difference one way or the other, and slipped his left hand under the girl's supporting arm, above the elbow, working his fingers up, making room for them between the warm surfaces of her upper arm and chest wall. He reached for the phone with his right hand.

event_2: "Hello?" he said resonantly into the phone. The girl stayed propped up on her forearm and watched him. Her eyes, more just open than alert or speculative, reflected chiefly their own size and color. A man's voice—stone dead, yet somehow rudely, almost obscenely quickened for the occasion—came through at the other end: "Lee? Did I wake you?" The gray-haired man glanced briefly left, at the girl. "Who's that?" he asked. "Arthur?" "Yeah—I wake you?" "No, no. I'm in bed, reading. Anything wrong?" "The reason I called, Lee, did you happen to notice when Joanie was leaving? Did you happen to notice if she left with the Ellenbogens, by any chance?" The gray-haired man looked left again, but high this time, away from the girl, who was now watching him rather like a young, blue-eyed Irish policeman.

event_3: "No, I didn't, Arthur," he said, his eyes on the far, dim end of the room, where the wall met the ceiling.
event_4: "All right, all right, try to take it a little easy, now, Arthur," the gray-haired man said.
event_5: "You call the Ellenbogens?" the gray-haired man asked.
event_6: "Where are you now, Arthur?" the gray-haired man asked.
event_7: "Look, Arthur, you want my advice?" he said.
event_8: "Yeah, I know."
event_9: "Arthur, listen, this isn't—"
event_10: "In the first place," the gray-haired man said, and slowly moved his hand and then caressed the little lock that rested on the girl’s forehead, "for a hell of an intelligent guy, you’re about as tactless as it’s humanly possible to be."
event_11: "Well, I do, I honestly do," the gray-haired man said.
event_12: "All right." The gray-haired man continued for a moment to hold the phone to his ear, then lowered it into its cradle.
event_13: "What did he say?" the girl immediately asked him.
event_14: "You were, you were wonderful," the girl said.
event_15: The phone suddenly rang.
event_16: "Hello?" he said into it.
event_17: "Yeah, she, she just barged in, about ten seconds after I spoke to you."
event_18: "No, no, I was just—No, no," the gray-haired man said, leaving his fingers bridged over his eyes.
