event_1: When the phone rang, the gray-haired man asked the girl, with quite some little deference, if she would rather for any reason he didn't answer it.
event_2: "Hello?" he said resonantly into the phone.
event_3: A man's voice—stone dead, yet somehow rudely, almost obscenely quickened for the occasion—came through at the other end: "Lee? Did I wake you?"
event_4: "The reason I called, Lee, did you happen to notice when Joanie was leaving? Did you happen to notice if she left with the Ellenbogens, by any chance?"
event_5: "You call the Ellenbogens?" the gray-haired man asked.
event_6: "I have a feeling she went to work on some bastard in the kitchen. I just have a feeling."
event_7: "Where are you now, Arthur?" the gray-haired man asked.
event_8: "Look, Arthur, you want my advice?" he said.
event_9: "You know what I do? You know what I do? I'm ashamed to—I’m ashamed to tell ya, but you know what I very nearly goddam do every night? When I get home? You want to know?"
event_10: "In the first place," he said into the phone, "I've told you many, many times, Arthur, that's exactly where you make your biggest mistake."
event_11: "In the first place," the gray-haired man said, and slowly moved his hand and then caressed the little lock that rested on the girl’s forehead, "for a hell of an intelligent guy, you’re about as tactless as it’s humanly possible to be."
event_12: "Now, Arthur, listen. I say this in all sincerity. Will you get undressed and get into bed, like a good guy? And relax?"
event_13: "Yeah. I hear you. Listen. I've kept you awake all night anyway. Could I come over to your place for a drink? Would you mind?"
event_14: "Well, I do, I honestly do," the gray-haired man said. "Look, why don't you hop in bed now, and relax, and then later, if you feel like it, give me a ring."
event_15: The gray-haired man continued for a moment to hold the phone to his ear, then lowered it into its cradle.
event_16: "What did he say?" the girl immediately asked him.
event_17: The phone suddenly rang.
event_18: "Hello?" he said into it. "Lee? Were you asleep?"
event_19: "Listen, I just thought you'd want to know, Joanie just barged in."
event_20: "Yeah, what, uh, what happened was, apparently Leona got stinking and then had a goddam crying jag, and Bob wanted Joanie to, to go out and grab a drink with them somewhere."
event_21: "Listen, Arthur," the gray-haired man interrupted, taking his hand away from his face, "I have a helluva headache all of a sudden."
event_22: He listened for another moment, then hung up.
