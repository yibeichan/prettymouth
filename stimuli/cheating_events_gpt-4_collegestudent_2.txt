event_1: When the phone rang, the gray-haired man asked the girl, with quite some little deference, if she would rather for any reason he didn't answer it.
event_2: The gray-haired man asked her to hurry up, and she raised up on her right forearm just quickly enough so that the movement didn't quite look perfunctory.
event_3: "Hello?" he said resonantly into the phone.
event_4: A man's voice—stone dead, yet somehow rudely, almost obscenely quickened for the occasion—came through at the other end: "Lee? Did I wake you?"
event_5: "No, I didn't, Arthur," he said, his eyes on the far, dim end of the room, where the wall met the ceiling.
event_6: "Oh Christ. Who knows? I don't know. You know her when she gets all tanked up and rarin' to go."
event_7: "Where are you now, Arthur?" the gray-haired man asked.
event_8: "Yeah. Home. Home sweet home. Christ."
event_9: "Yeah, I know. I wouldn't even worry, for Chrissake, but you can't trust her! I swear to God. I swear to God you can't."
event_10: "You know what I do? You know what I do? I'm ashamed to—I’m ashamed to tell ya, but you know what I very nearly goddam do every night?"
event_11: "All right. All right. Let's try to take it a little easy, Arthur," the gray-haired man said.
event_12: "In the first place," he said into the phone, "I've told you many, many times, Arthur, that's exactly where you make your biggest mistake."
event_13: "In the first place," the gray-haired man said, and slowly moved his hand and then caressed the little lock that rested on the girl’s forehead, "for a hell of an intelligent guy, you’re about as tactless as it’s humanly possible to be."
event_14: "We're mismated, that's all. That's the whole simple story. We're just mismated as hell."
event_15: "In the first place," the gray-haired man said, lowering his hand from his head, "I mean you’re, you're more than welcome to come, but I honestly think you should just sit tight and relax till Joanie waltzes in."
event_16: "All right." The gray-haired man continued for a moment to hold the phone to his ear, then lowered it into its cradle.
event_17: "What did he say?" the girl immediately asked him.
event_18: "You were, you were wonderful," the girl said.
event_19: The phone suddenly rang.
event_20: "Hello?" he said into it.
event_21: "Yeah, she, she just barged in, about ten seconds after I spoke to you. I just thought I'd give you a ring while she's in the john."
event_22: "Listen, Arthur," the gray-haired man interrupted, taking his hand away from his face, "I have a helluva headache all of a sudden."
event_23: He listened for another moment, then hung up.
